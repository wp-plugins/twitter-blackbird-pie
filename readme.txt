Add awesome looking embedded HTML representations of actual tweets in your blog posts just by adding simple shortcodes. Please read the blog post at http://themergency.com/twitter-blackbird-pie-wordpress-plugin/ for more info and to see the plugin in action.

The plugins has the following features:

*   Exact same look and feel as the respective Twitter profile.
*   Allows for multiple "pies" in a single post (as seen in the examples below).
*   Stores the generated HTML in a custom field (if possible), so the Twitter API is only called the first time.
*   Slightly better styling than the original Blackbird Pie
    *   Better use of the Twitter profile background image and color and tiling.
    *   Uses the Twitter profile text color.
    *   Uses the Twitter profile link color.
*   Uses the jQuery Time Ago plugin to display a "real time" datetime of when the tweet was tweeted.
*   Auto-linking of URLs, hashtags, usernames within the tweet text.
*   Use either the id or full URL of the tweet.
